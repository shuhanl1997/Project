          <p>I am Shuhan Liu and I am a third year SIAT major student based in Simon Fraser University.
            A Chinese girl having grown up in a traditional family. I love arts and culture,
            and I exploited many classical elements for my own design.
            My keen passion in design since my childhood has filled my life with more inspirations.
            I was exposed to knowledge of interactive design and graphic design.
            I fairly enjoyed the group works, as I realized that opinions and suggestions from others are
            conducive to addressing my own deficiencies and to creating diversity
            and possibility in our design work. </p>

            <p>  This is a project I created in IAT102 at Simon Fraser University. My teammate
              and I have worked on magazine design. We are asked to create a magazine cover and
              two pages of the magazine. For the first step, we decided the topic of the magazine is
              an architecture mag which the issue name is “Hold the Art”. Then we brainstormed
              some magazine layouts and created three sketches for each idea. After we finished to
              sketch out the magazine ideas, we started our first mockup and try the ideas. During
              this step, we found it was really hard to find images in which the resolution is
              highenough to make the magazine seems
              clear enough for our audience so we spent some
              time on finding high-quality illustrations.</p>
              <p>The software is used for this project is InDesign and Lightroom. In the beginning, we
              were not familiar with either of this software so my teammate and I have searched a lot
              of
              tutorials on lynda.com to learn how to use the tools. We also attended all the labs and
              asked for
              our professor and TA’s advice. At this stage, we started finding the font we want to use
              for the
              magazine. Since the topic we chose is an architecture mag, we used three levels of text
              and
              font styles to set the overall style of the magazine. For the headings, we used the
              transitional
              font, Sans serif or serif fonts. For the sub-headings, we used the humanest font, Sans
              serif or
              serif fonts and the body text using the same fonts as the headings.</p>
              <p>  For the third stage, we officially began to make the logo and the magazine in
                InDesign. We used software such as PS and AI to cut the images and add effects to the
                images. As we have learned in the lecture and lab about the margin, white space and
                some other technical strategies, we were always aware of the details of the magazine
                page so the mag will look visually better and more consistent.</p>
            <p> In conclusion, the whole working process is very fun and the toughest part was to
              learn the new design tools. Graphic designers must learn new tools quickly and
              efficiently and make the product neat to present to the users. I am really glad to learn
              this course and make this project with my teammate.</p>

          <p>The artifact is my second project from IAT100. The theme of this project
            is to compose a short comic story based on an existing film or written piece.
            The project also requires building
            on photo sequence and adjusting the effects on photos making them look like comics. </p></br>
          <p>
            To begin with, I created a mind map to help me determine the horror topic.
            Subsequently, I started to create my storyboard, adopting desired shot angles,
            shot types and strategies when shooting my story.
            However, I found it difficult to tell the story in 10 to 20 frames as required.
            To solve this problem, I built a brief storyline and drew a storyboard to describe the plot.
            Next, the storyboard was modified according to the storyline keep only key frames and concentrated
            more on the development of the story. I also employed diverse orders of the key
            images to ensure the story to be easy for the readers to understand. </p> <br>
          <p>When I started editing the photos, another problem was that the project required the use of diverse skills,
            including the use of software (e.g., photoshops, illustrator, Lightroom and indesign)
            to create the layout and endow those photos with comic effects. I was not professional with the software.
            Also, since it was my first year in university, it became much more difficult for me to learn everything in
            a few weeks.
            Thus, I spent at least three hours per day learning the software on lynda.com, youtube.com, and finding
            professors and TA to ask for advice and help me in software training. The experience when building this
            project
            has brought me a chance to learn diverse software and knowing how to use time efficiently in learning
            new things and communicate with professors and TAs. </p>
          <p>During the whole process of making this comic book, I learned skills of using
          diverse softwares, and with the courage and help of my friends and teachers, I feel it
          is
          mandatory that a designer should focus on his/her artwork, work hard to learn new
          things and keep exploring new fields.</p>
